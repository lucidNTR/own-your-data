		<p>
			The internet was built on a promise of decentralization, but we've
			allowed it to become a feudal estate. Tech giants treat your digital
			life as a raw material to be extracted, refined, and sold to the
			highest bidder. They pretend to give you ownership to appease
			regulators. In reality they go out of their way to cripple access
			and make every step as painful as possible. Companies hide behind
			false flags of security and privacy to justify taking more and more
			of your control.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>This is not a glitch. It is the business model.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			In the age of AI, this extraction accelerates. Your thoughts, your
			creativity, your very identity are being strip-mined to train the
			algorithms that will feed you poison. Owning your data isn't just
			about privacy anymore; it's about self-determination. It's about
			refusing to be a tenant in a digital world you helped build.
		</p>
		<p>
			It's time to prepare for a world of infinite software enabled by
			personal AI where we can make use of every bit of our data just as
			corporations can today. But made for us and to our terms.

		<strong>Mission</strong>
		We believe it is a human right to fully own and control the data we create
		and participate on. This right is only satisfied if the access is machine
		readable, structured, instant, up to date, frictionless, and does not require
		begging or interacting with gatekeepers. The data includes everything we
		create or is created about us, metadata and primary data. We have the right
		to store, transfer, compute and automate however we like. We have a right
		to access our feeds and our networks in the same way as our own data, as
		long as we do not republish the data that is not our own. Effectively that
		means a human right to use our own clients, true user agents, for any platform.
