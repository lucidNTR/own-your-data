		<p>
			Tech giants treat your digital life as a raw material to be extracted, refined, and sold to
			the highest bidder. They pretend to give you control to appease regulators. In reality, they
			go out of their way to cripple data access and make every step as painful as
			possible — partly to keep you locked in, partly to hide how much they know, partly to keep you
			in a consumer mindset, or simply because there's no profit in it. Companies hide behind
			false flags of security and privacy to justify stripping away your control.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>This is not a glitch. It is the business model.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			In the age of AI, this extraction accelerates. Your thoughts, your
			creativity and your very identity are being strip-mined to train the
			algorithms that will feed you poison. Owning your data isn't just
			about privacy anymore; it's about self-determination.
		</p>
		<p>
			It's time to prepare for a world of infinite software enabled by
			personal AI where we can make use of every bit of our data just as
			corporations can today. But made for us and to our terms.

		<strong>Why Would You Care?</strong>
		<p>
			Private full-text search across your digital life. Custom apps for anything — personal
			accounting, health tracking, quantified self. Rich context for your personal AI. True data
			portability between services. A backup for when platforms shut down, delete your account, or
			simply vanish. Even things that were not feasible until now will become possible with personal AI that generates personal applications just for you.
		</p>
		<p>
			Even if none of this appeals to you today, it's in your interest to defend this right. If we
			give up now, we'll only realise what we lost when it's too late.

		<strong>Mission</strong>
		We believe it is a human right to fully own and control the data we create
		and participate on. This right is only satisfied if the access is machine
		readable, structured, instant, up to date, frictionless, and does not require
		begging or interacting with gatekeepers. The data includes everything we
		create or is created about us, metadata and primary data. We have the right
		to store, transfer, compute and automate however we like. We have a right
		to access our feeds and our networks in the same way as our own data, as
		long as it is not republished without the permission of the original data owner.
