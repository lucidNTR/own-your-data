			The internet was built on a promise of decentralization, but we've
			allowed it to become a feudal estate. Tech giants don't just predict
			your behavior; they manufacture it. They treat your digital life as
			a raw material to be extracted, refined, and sold to the highest
			bidder.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>This is not a glitch. It is the business model.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			In the age of AI, this extraction accelerates. Your thoughts, your
			creativity, your very identity are being strip-mined to train the
			algorithms that will replace you. Owning your data isn't just about
			privacy anymore; it's about self-determination. It's about refusing
			to be a tenant in a digital world you helped build.
		</p>
		<p>It's time to seize the means of computation.</p>

		<strong>Core Principle</strong>
		We believe it is a human right to fully own and control the data we create
		and participate on. This right is only satisfied if the access is instant,
		up to date, frictionless, and does not require begging or interacting with
		gatekeepers.
